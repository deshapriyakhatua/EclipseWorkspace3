## Project Description

The "Find Friends Nearby" project provides a platform that simplifies the process of finding like-minded individuals nearby. Whether you're in a new city, attending an event, or just looking to expand your social circle, this project offers a solution to connect with people who are physically close and share your hobbies or interests.
This project is designed to bridge the gap between online interactions and real-life friendships. By utilizing location-based matching and emphasizing shared interests, the platform aims to create genuine connections that can lead to lasting friendships and meaningful experiences.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Key Features

- Geolocation Integration: The project integrates with location services to determine a user's current location, ensuring that potential friend matches are in close proximity.

- User Profiles: Users can create profiles with their interests, hobbies, and a brief bio. This information helps in identifying potential friends who share similar passions.

- Matching Algorithm: The project employs a matching algorithm that considers user preferences, interests, and proximity to suggest potential friends.

- Real-Time Messaging: Once users connect, they can communicate through a real-time messaging system, making it easy to plan meetups and get to know each other.

- Privacy Controls: Users have the ability to control their privacy settings and choose what information they want to share publicly.

- Notification System: The platform notifies users when there are potential friend matches nearby, encouraging them to initiate conversations and build connections.


## How It Works

- Profile Creation: Users create detailed profiles including their interests, a profile picture, and a brief description of themselves.

- Location Sharing: The platform uses the user's device location to determine their proximity to other users.

- Matching Process: The matching algorithm suggests potential friends based on shared interests and proximity.

- Connecting: Users can view profiles of potential matches and choose to connect. If both users agree, they become friends and gain access to the messaging feature.

- Messaging: Friends can exchange messages in real-time, making it easy to arrange meetups or learn more about each other.

- Privacy: Users have control over what information they share and can adjust their privacy settings as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- In the future, the project could expand by incorporating additional features such as:

- Interest-Based Groups: Allowing users to join and create groups centered around specific interests or activities.

- Event Integration: Displaying local events and activities to further facilitate real-life interactions between users.

- Enhanced Privacy Settings: Giving users more granular control over who can see their profile and location information.

- Multi-Platform Support: Developing mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms to enhance accessibility.
